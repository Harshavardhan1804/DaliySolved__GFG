Stock span problem




stack = []
        span = [0] * n  # Initialize span array with zeros

        for i in range(n):
            # Initialize span for the current price
            span[i] = 1

            # Calculate span for the current price
            while stack and a[i] >= a[stack[-1]]:
                span[i] += span[stack[-1]]
                stack.pop()
            
            # Push the current index to the stack
            stack.append(i)
